Git Cheat Sheeet





step1) first of all create a repository on your git hub account



than open powershell and go to your code folder 





# git init --> it initlize your current folder  as a git repository

# vim README.md --> overview or discreption of your repository

# git config --global user.name gitusername

# git config --global user.email git email address

config command will configure your credentials over git repository and if you

used --global it will apply to all repository current or future



#git add . --> it will add all files from current repository

#git status --> staging area, where we can which files are added and which are

still to be added at git staging area

#git commit -m "any message regarding changes" --> This will create a version

for your git repository, every time you commit something you are creating a

new version of your code



#git remote add origin https://gihub.com/username/project_name.git --> it will

link your online repository to offline repository with name origin, so every

time you write origin in this current directory meas you are reffering to

https://github.com/username/project-name.git



#git push origin master --> It will upload all of your local data files to

your remote repository ( internet connection required )



#git pull origin master --> It will fetch all the changes that has been

commited to your directory  



--> if you have an error of unrelated histories than follow this step

#git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories

#git status --> see which files has conflict issues ( see red files )

#git add . --> make sure you have reviewed your changes and merged all changes

#git commit -m "message" --> to acknowledge your changes as well as merges"

#git push origin master --> origin is remote destination where we want to upload our files and master is your main branch





---> if you have large files more than 100MB than you need to configure GIT-LFS account



step1) search for the git lfs download page on google

step2) download git_lfs.exe program and install it in windows with default permission

step3) open command shell ( powershell ) and type command git install lfs to tell git to use lfs
